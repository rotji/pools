the problem
Millions of people lose money investing alone in high-risk markets like stocks, crypto, forex, and gambling. Individual investors face unpredictable outcomes, lack of transparency, and often get wiped out by market swings or scams. There is no easy way for everyday people to pool risk and share both profits and losses fairly.

the need
People need a safer, more transparent way to invest together, reduce individual risk, and benefit from collective strategies. There is a growing demand for platforms that allow group pooling, automatic settlements, and on-chain transparency, especially in emerging markets like Nigeria where financial trust is low and access to traditional investment vehicles is limited.

our solution
Our platform enables users to form or join investment groups where everyone contributes the same amount, invests in different assets, and shares all profits or losses equally. Smart contracts guarantee fair, automatic settlements, and every transaction is recorded on-chain for full transparency. The platform acts as a neutral referee, not a fund manager, and supports crypto, stocks, forex, and more.

the market
The global retail investment market is over $100 trillion, with over $2 trillion in crypto assets alone. In Nigeria, over 54% of adults are financially excluded or underserved, and more than 33 million people have tried high-risk investments or gambling. The African fintech market is projected to reach $150 billion by 2025. Group savings and investment clubs ("esusu") are deeply rooted in local culture, but lack digital, transparent, and scalable solutions. Globally, platforms like eToro have over 30 million users, and the demand for social investing is growing rapidly.

business model
We charge a small fee on group settlements, offer premium features for private groups, and provide API integrations for partners. Additional revenue comes from value-added services like analytics, KYC/AML compliance, and white-label solutions for financial institutions.

competitive advantage
We combine on-chain transparency, group pooling, and multi-asset support in one platform. Our solution is mobile-first, easy to use, and designed for both local and global markets. We leverage smart contracts for trustless settlements and offer deep integration with local payment systems and wallets.

competitors
Local competitors: Cowrywise, PiggyVest, Bamboo, Trove, Risevest, Chaka. These focus on savings or individual investing, not group pooling or on-chain settlements. Global competitors: eToro, Public.com, Fintual, Robinhood, Syndicate.io, Syndicate Protocol. Most global players lack local payment integration, group pooling, or blockchain-based settlements.

scalability
Our platform is built as a modular, API-driven system with smart contracts and off-chain oracles. It can scale to millions of users, support new asset classes, and expand to other African and global markets. The architecture supports white-label deployments and integration with banks, fintechs, and DeFi protocols.
